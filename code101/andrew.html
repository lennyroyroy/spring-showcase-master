<p class="intro">Hello Welcome to a Brief History of Pokemon (good for you if get the reference) let's start!  Our god Satoshi Tajiri wanted to make a game, inspired by him capturing insects and tadpols near his home in Tokyo(weird I know) and wanted children to feel the same fun he had as a child.  SO he made GAME FREAK, built by him and his friends, when he looked at the <span class="game">GAME BOY</span> and thought he would like to make a game for cathing insects and transfering them through the <span class="game">GAME BOY GAME LINK CABLE</span>.  He proposed the game "Capsule Monsters" but was rejected.   <span class="lennyroyugly">Nintendo</span> but they rejected his idea, but his friend Shigeru Miyamoto, Nintendo then funded the project and they built a game for 6 years that would become a sensation around the world.</p>
